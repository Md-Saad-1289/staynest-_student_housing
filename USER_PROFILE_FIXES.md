# User Profile Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document outlines all bugs found and fixed in the user profile functionality across the backend and frontend.

---

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### 1. **Backend: Incomplete getCurrentUser Response** ✅ FIXED

**File:** `backend/src/controllers/authController.js`

**Issue:**

- The `getCurrentUser` endpoint was only returning basic user information (id, name, email, mobile, role, isVerified)
- Missing important profile fields: `profileImage`, `bio`, `university`, `location`, `linkedin`, `twitter`, `website`, `createdAt`

**Impact:**

- Profile pages couldn't display complete user information after login
- Users had to wait for additional API calls to fetch full profile data

**Fix:**

- Updated the response to include all profile-related fields
- Now returns complete user profile information in a single request

```javascript
// Added fields to response:
(profileImage,
  bio,
  university,
  location,
  linkedin,
  twitter,
  website,
  createdAt);
```

### 2. **Backend: updateProfile Missing Social Links** ✅ FIXED

**File:** `backend/src/controllers/authController.js`

**Issue:**

- The `updateProfile` endpoint didn't handle `linkedin`, `twitter`, `website` fields
- Frontend was sending these fields but they were being ignored

**Impact:**

- Social links couldn't be saved to the database
- Users couldn't add their social media profiles

**Fix:**

- Added destructuring for social link fields
- Added fields to the update object and response
- Now properly saves and returns all social links

```javascript
// Added to destructuring:
const { ..., linkedin, twitter, website } = req.body;

// Added to updates object:
if (typeof linkedin !== 'undefined') updates.linkedin = linkedin;
if (typeof twitter !== 'undefined') updates.twitter = twitter;
if (typeof website !== 'undefined') updates.website = website;
```

### 3. **Backend: Missing Mobile Validation in updateProfile** ✅ FIXED

**File:** `backend/src/controllers/authController.js`

**Issue:**

- The `updateProfile` endpoint didn't validate phone numbers
- Users could save invalid phone numbers

**Impact:**

- Data corruption with invalid phone numbers
- No consistency between registration and profile update validation

**Fix:**

- Added validation to ensure mobile has at least 8 digits
- Returns clear error message if validation fails

```javascript
if (mobile && typeof mobile === "string") {
  const digits = mobile.replace(/[^0-9]/g, "");
  if (digits.length < 8) {
    return res
      .status(400)
      .json({ error: "Phone number must have at least 8 digits" });
  }
}
```

### 4. **Frontend: UserProfilePage - Email Editing Issue** ✅ FIXED

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/UserProfilePage.js`

**Issue:**

- Email field was editable in the UI
- Backend didn't support email updates (removed feature for security)
- Validation included email but not enforced on save

**Impact:**

- Users could attempt to change email but changes wouldn't be saved
- Confusing UX

**Fix:**

- Made email field read-only in edit mode
- Added explanatory message: "Email cannot be changed"
- Removed email from validation schema
- Updated validation to require mobile number

---

### 5. **Frontend: UserProfilePage - Validation Issues** ✅ FIXED

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/UserProfilePage.js`

**Issue:**

- Validation schema had email requirements that weren't supported
- Mobile validation existed but wasn't enforced on save
- Name field could be empty after validation

**Impact:**

- Users confused about what fields they can edit
- Silent failures when updating profile

**Fix:**

- Simplified validation to only check required fields (name, mobile)
- Mobile now required with at least 8 digits
- Added error messages for validation failures
- Added placeholder text in phone field

---

### 6. **Frontend: ProfilePage - Incomplete Social Links Saving** ✅ FIXED

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.js`

**Issue:**

- Social link inputs (LinkedIn, Twitter, Website) existed in UI but weren't sent to backend
- Form data wasn't initialized with these fields when editing

**Impact:**

- Data loss when saving profiles
- Social links form fields had no effect

**Fix:**

- Added social links to form initialization
- Included all social fields in the update payload
- Added validation for name and mobile fields before save

```javascript
// Form initialization now includes:
setFormData({
  ...,
  linkedin: user.linkedin || '',
  twitter: user.twitter || '',
  website: user.website || ''
})

// Payload now includes:
const payload = {
  ...,
  linkedin: formData.linkedin || '',
  twitter: formData.twitter || '',
  website: formData.website || ''
}
```

### 7. **Frontend: ProfilePage - Better Error Handling** ✅ FIXED

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.js`

**Issue:**

- Error messages were generic and not helpful
- Validation errors from backend weren't properly displayed

**Impact:**

- Users didn't know why profile updates failed

**Fix:**

- Added client-side validation before sending request
- Improved error message display from backend responses
- Added specific validation messages for name and mobile

```javascript
const errorMsg =
  err?.response?.data?.error || err?.message || "Failed to save profile";
```
