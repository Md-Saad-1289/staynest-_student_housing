# 🏠 NestroStay — Student Housing Platform

Every academic year, Dhaka welcomes thousands of students chasing opportunity—new universities, new dreams, new pressure. But before classes begin, there’s a silent first battle almost every student fights alone: **finding a place to live**.

What should be a simple decision quickly turns into stress. Facebook groups full of outdated posts. Phone numbers that don’t respond. Rents that change after a visit. Promises that don’t match reality. For many students—especially those new to the city—one wrong choice means months of discomfort, safety concerns, or wasted money. Parents worry. Students lose focus. Education takes a back seat.

**NestroStay** started as a question:  
*Why is student housing still this broken in a city powered by technology?*

This MVP is built on a simple belief—students deserve transparency, and property owners deserve a fair, organized system to reach the right people. NestroStay imagines a single, trusted space where student messes and hostels are visible, verifiable, and review-driven. Where decisions are based on facts, not fear. Where accountability replaces uncertainty.

At its core, NestroStay is not just a listing platform. It’s a trust layer between students and housing providers. By introducing clear roles, verified listings, and real experiences from real students, the platform aims to reduce friction at the most vulnerable moment of a student’s journey—starting something new in an unfamiliar city.

This is an MVP, but it represents something bigger:  
a future where students spend less time searching for shelter and more time building their lives.
